        Artificial Intelligence exists there, where a machine can have <br>
        human based skills such as learning, reasoning, and solving
        problems. <br><br> 
        The intelligent digital personal
        assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, <br>Cortana, Alexa are
        all powered by AI. <br> <br> 
        
        AI system can also learn from
        past experiences or outcomes to <br> make new decisions. <br><br>
        A knowledge base is
        a store of information
        consisting of facts,<br>
        assumptions and
        rules which an AI
        system can use for
        decision making. <br> <br>

        Machine Learning is a subsystem of Artificial 
        Intelligence,<br> wherein computers have the ability to learn 
        from data using statistical techniques, <br> without being
         explicitly programmed by a human being. <br><br> It comprises 
        algorithms that use data to learn on their own and make
        predictions.<br> <br> These algorithms, called models, are first 
        trained <br>and tested using a training data and testing

            <dd> Virtual Reality (VR) is use of computer technology
                to create a simulated environment.<br>Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience.<br>
                Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to <br>interact with 3D worlds/objects.

                    immersive 3D environment. Each VR headset puts up a screen in front of eyes thus,<br>  eliminating any interaction with the real world. <br> </li>
<br> <li>Two autofocus lenses are generally placed between the screen and the eyes that <br> adjust based on individual eye movement and positioning. <br></li>
<br> <li>The visuals on the screen are rendered either by using a mobile phone <br> or HDMI cable connected to a PC. <br></li>

A robot is basically a machine capable of carrying out one
        or more tasks automatically <br>with accuracy and precision.
        Unlike other machines, a robot is programmable, which
        means <br>it can follow the instructions given through
        computer programs.<br><br>
        Robots that resemble
humans are known as humanoids. <br>
        Robots are being
used in industries, medical science, bionics, scientific
research, military, etc.  </p>
